    <h2>Why MVVM?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        MVVM is a well-known architectural pattern, mostly used in .NET or
        Angular application development, but can also be found in other
        frameworks and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angular itself already uses an MVVM-like approach where View can be
        referred to component's template, and ViewModel to component's
        code-behind class. However, including a presentational logic in
        code-behind code of the component is usually not a good idea, because
        very often it is loosely coupled with a component, and either duplicates
        a code or does not provide a good separation of concerns.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, the goals of following architectural design are:</p>
      <ul class="fw-bolder">
        <li>Writing as little and as native code as possible</li>
        <li>Easy to learn</li>
        <li>Better separation of concerns and better testability</li>
        <li>Scalability</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
      </ul>

            style="height: 10rem">Model</span>
        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The Model is usually referred to data access layer, however, it can
          also contain a business logic of the application.
        </p>
        <ul
          class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-column justify-content-center mt-4 mb-5 p-3 text-center border rounded w-100">

        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The ViewModel is a layer of presentational logic and keeps a state of
          the View and operations that can be performed within a View. ViewModel
          is also responsible for notifying a View about its state changes,
          validating user inputs or communication with the Model layer.
        </p>
        <ul
          class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-column justify-content-center mt-4 mb-5 p-3 text-center border rounded w-100">
          <li>Bindings</li>
          <li>Commands</li>
          <li>Value Changes</li>

          <span class="badge bg-primary d-flex flex-column justify-content-center w-100"
            style="height: 10rem">View</span>
        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The View can be referred to a display component, which consumes
          ViewModel in order to bind the state of its properties or action
          triggers. Using ReactiveForms we can also perform so-called two-way
          binding and synchronize user input back to the ViewModel. The View is
          updated when a state of ViewModel has changed.

    <h2>Creating ViewModel</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Once we are settled on folder structure, we can add our first ViewModel
        by creating a class suffixed with ViewModel and extending ViewModel
        class from NgToolkit. Each ViewModel has to call the init() function in
        order to emit changes of its Observables or FormControls.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewModelInit"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        You can also notice that a ViewModel is treated as injectable service.
        This will help us to either mock it during testing or reuse the
        functionality at multiple places without depending on a View.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we have created our first ViewModel, let's add a ReactiveForm and
        Observable. Their state will be further used in a ViewModel methods or
        using bindings in a View.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewModelObservables"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        Last, but not least, let's add some methods to either add or remove an
        item of form.samples array.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewModelMethods"></app-code-highlighter>

  <!-- creating-view -->
  <section id="creating-view" aria-label="Creating View">
    <h2>Creating View</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        After we have created a ViewModel, we also need a display component
        called View. In component's code-behind file we will then define a
        provider for a ViewModel, so each component has its own instance (if you
        rather wish to share a ViewModel between multiple components, define a
        provider in one of the parent Views or parent NgModule).
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewInit"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        As you can notice, our ViewModel type will be then injected to public
        property called vm upon component's creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In HTML template we then subscribe to all changes of the ViewModel
        observables only once using async pipe.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewSubscription"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        And we can bind Observable and FormControl instances (as well as their
        values), or the methods defined on the ViewModel.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewBindings"></app-code-highlighter>

  </section>

  <!-- parent-viewmodels -->
  <section id="parent-viewmodels" aria-label="Parent ViewModels">
    <h2>Parent ViewModels</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Your application might contain a tree of a View components which needs
        to share a specific functionality. In such cases we should structure the
        application so there is always at least one parent View on the way up to
        the root View. Then we can easily inject any of parent ViewModels in
        ViewModel constructor as its dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, that any parent ViewModel which properties will be bound in
        the View has to be passed to init(...parentViewModels) function.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.parentViewModelInit"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        Afterwards, we can access all its public properties or methods within a
        ViewModel or a View. Bindings of such a properties will be always in
        sync, and View will be marked for change detection whenever there is a
        change to parent ViewModel observables.
      </p>

  <!-- viewmodel-context -->
  <section id="viewmodel-context" aria-label="ViewModel Context">
    <h2>ViewModel Context</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In case there are multiple instances of a View on same level, we might
        need to pass down some properties to its ViewModel. In such a case you
        can use ViewModelContextDirective and define it as a dependency on child
        ViewModel.
      </p>
      <p>First you will have to import MvvmModule module.</p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.mvvmModuleImport"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        Then define a provider with additional properties within a loop
        rendering.
      </p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewModelContextDirectiveProvider"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>And inject a directive in child ViewModel.</p>
      <app-code-highlighter [code]="snippets.viewModelContextDirectiveInjector"></app-code-highlighter>
      <p>
        Last but not least, we can use the context to call a method on a parent
        ViewModel and define an index at which item should be deleted.
      </p>
