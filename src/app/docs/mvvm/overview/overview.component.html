    <h2>Why MVVM?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        MVVM is a well-known architectural pattern, mostly used in .NET or
        Android application development, but can also be found in other
        frameworks and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angular itself already uses an MVVM-like approach where View can be
        referred to component's template, and ViewModel to component's class.
        However, including a presentational logic in code-behind code of the the
        component is not always a good idea, because very often it is loosely
        coupled with a component, and either duplicates a code or does not
        provide a good separation of concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, developers usually manage a state of the application using
        services layer or 3rd party solutions like NgRx. NgRx provides great
        separation of concerns, however, it is also connected with a slower
        learning curve and requires a lot of boilerplate code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, NgToolkit proposes an architecture that corresponds
        more with Angular native approach to the UI development and MVVM pattern
        as known from .NET development. MVVM implementation of NgToolkit is
        more-or-less an architectural proposal extended with ViewModel base
        class implementation that notifies a View about the changes of ViewModel
        observables or ReactiveForm instances.

    <h2>Layers of MVVM</h2>
    <p>
      Please note, that the following description might not correspond to
      "traditional" MVVM model that thinks about the Model layer more in terms
      of a backend application, but tries to exclusively organize the frontend
      application code.
    </p>
    <div>
      <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
        <div class="h3 w-100">
          <span
            class="badge bg-warning d-flex flex-column justify-content-center w-100"
            style="height: 10rem"
            >Model</span
          >
        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The Model is usually referred to data access layer, however, it can
          also contain a business logic of the application.
        </p>
        <p class="align-self-start">For example:</p>
        <ul class="align-self-start">
          <li>A service used to create, read, update or delete data.</li>
          <li>
            A service containing or providing some kind of business-logic.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul
          class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-column justify-content-center mt-4 mb-5 p-3 text-center border rounded w-100"
        >
          <li>Send data</li>
          <li>Receive data</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="h3 w-100">
          <span
            class="badge bg-success d-flex flex-column justify-content-center w-100"
            style="height: 10rem"
            >ViewModel</span
          >
        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The ViewModel is a layer of presentational logic and keeps a state of
          the View and operations that can be performed within a View. ViewModel
          is also responsible for notifying a View about its state changes,
          validating user inputs or communication with the Model layer.
        </p>
        <ul
          class="list-unstyled d-flex flex-column justify-content-center mt-4 mb-5 p-3 text-center border rounded w-100"
        >
          <li>2-Way Bindings</li>
          <li>Commands</li>
          <li>Value Changes</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="h3 w-100">
          <span
            class="badge bg-primary d-flex flex-column justify-content-center w-100"
            style="height: 10rem"
            >View</span
          >
        </div>
        <p class="align-self-start">
          The View can be referred to a display component, which consumes
          ViewModel in order to bind the state of its properties or action
          triggers. Using ReactiveForms we can also perform so-called two-way
          binding and synchronize user input back to the ViewModel. The View is
          updated when a state of ViewModel has changed.
